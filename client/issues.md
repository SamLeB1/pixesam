- The move undo/redo action doesn't work with resizing.

- Copying doesn't copy scaled pixels.

- While resizing, the wrong cursor is shown and the active resize handle is unhovered.

- If a resize handle is clicked, selectionStartPos can be outside of the effective selection bounds which causes resizing to be delayed.
